<h1>Text fade-in</h1>
<p data-lining data-auto-resize>Now, this is a story all about how, My life got flipped-turned upside down, And I'd like to take a minute, Just sit right there, I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air! In west Philadelphia born and raised, On the playground was where I spent most of my days, Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool, And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school, When a couple of guys who were up to no good, Started making trouble in my neighborhood, I got in one little fight and my mom got scared, She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'! I begged and pleaded with her day after day, But she packed my suit case and sent me on my way, She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my ticket, I put my Walkman on and said, 'I might as well kick it'! First class, yo this is bad, Drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass, Is this what the people of Bel-Air living like?, Hmmmmm this might be alright! But wait I hear they're prissy, bourgeois, all that, Is this the type of place that they just send this cool cat?, I don't think so, I'll see when I get there, I hope they're prepared for the prince of Bel-Air! Well, the plane landed and when I came out, There was a dude who looked like a cop standing there with my name out, I ain't trying to get arrested yet, I just got here, I sprang with the quickness like lightning, disappeared! I whistled for a cab and when it came near, The license plate said fresh and it had dice in the mirror, If anything I could say that this cab was rare, But I thought 'Nah, forget it' - 'Yo, homes to Bel Air'! I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8, And I yelled to the cabbie 'Yo homes smell ya later', I looked at my kingdom, I was finally there, To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.
